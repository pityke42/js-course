/*
abstraction is hiding low level details 
encapsulation keep properies and methods private in the class, these are not accessable from outside of the class, methods can exposed as a publis api
inheritance child class extends the parent class, properties and methods avaliable to the child class to reuse logic, 
polymorphism child class can overwrite a method that it inherited from a parent class

prototypal inheritance the prototype contains methods that are accessavle to all objects linked to that prototype
objects delegate behaviour to the linked prototyp object
methods are copied from the class to the objects
